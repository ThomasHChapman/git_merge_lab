#git_merge_lab

#In this lab I created a file in the main branch called numbers.py that squared each number from 1-10.

#I then created a second branch called cubes, and modified numbers.py within that branch to cube each number from 1-10. I 
added and committed numbers.py in the cubes branch.

#finally, I merged cubes into the main branch and deleted the development branch.

#to close things out, I pushed the results to github, leaving one remaining branch.
